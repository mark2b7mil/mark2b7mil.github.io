# NIST Cloud Definition and Architecture

Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that 
can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

The cloud model is composed of 5 characteristics: on demand self service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service

There are 4 deployment models: private cloud - used by a single org comprising multiple consumers. community cloud - used by a community of consumers from orgs with a shared concern. public cloud - for use by general public, exists on the cloud provider premises. hybrid cloud - a composition of 2 or more cloud structures, unique entities bound by standardized tech.

The NIST cloud reference architecure is made up of 5 actors: 

1. Cloud consumer - user of cloud services provided by cloud providers
2. Cloud provider - makes the cloud service available to people or orgs
3. Cloud auditor - conudcts indeptendt assessment of cloud services, including performance and security
4. Cloud broker - manages how cloud servies are used, their performance and delivery
5. Cloud carrier - provides connection and transport of cloud services

Cloud consumers may break up the needed services among different departments like HR getiing Saas,
app developers get paas, and it get iaas.

Cloud provider activity can be service deployment, orchestration, services management, security, and privacy.

Auditors perform their roles to verify conformance to standards, and evaluate services provided.
Audits can help agencies comply with regulation and policy.

Often cloud services may be overwhelming in their setup for consumers, which is where brokers step in.
Brokers simplify life for consumers by providing intermediation like managing access to services, identity management, and performance reporting, and security
Aggregation, provides data integration and secures data movement. Arbitrage, meaning the broker 
can choose serv ices from different agencies.

Cloud provider services are split into the service layer where SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS are located. 
There is the resource abstraction and control layer like hypervisors, virtual machine, etc.
and then the physical resource layer. 

The three service models for cloud computing Saas, IaaS, and PaaS all come with different security concerns.
There are different forms of exposure in each service.
